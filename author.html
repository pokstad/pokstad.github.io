		<h2>Paul Okstad</h2>
		<p>Just a cool guy writing some code, swinging kettlebells, and throwing frisbees for his wolf pup all while keeping his wife happy.</p>

		<p>I'm a Southern California native who loves the casual beach lifestyle. The warm weather affords me the ability to stay active all year round.</p>
		<p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science from CSULB in 2009. I worked in aerospace for over 8 years, but I left that world to focus on a future in mobile apps and web development.</p>
		<p>Today I work on the best selling <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bodyweight-training-you-are/id416981420?mt=8">Bodyweight Trainer iOS app</a> based on <a href="https://www.marklauren.com/books.html">Mark Lauren's book You Are Your Own Gym.</a> I also do contracting work if the work is interesting and the pay allows me to continue buying fish tacos in bulk every Tuesday.</p>
		<p>Besides work, I spend time at home with my wife and our pup. I'm either throwing frisbees at the dog park, swinging kettlebells, or on the mat practicing Brazillian Jiu Jitsu. Sometimes I'll have a tastey beer to keep things fun.</p>
