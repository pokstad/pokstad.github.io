When writing code, an abundance of documentation is always welcome to guide future readers and contributors (which includes yourself). Documentation is so important in Go, that the language was designed with a standardized approach to writing good code comments that could be autogenerated into documentation (see the [Go team's official blog post on documentation](https://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code)).

There are amazing tools that expose the power of Go documentation, such as [godoc](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc). At the heart of godoc, is a simple package in the standard library called [doc](https://golang.org/pkg/go/doc). Doc contains a set of standard conventions for interacting with Go documentation. This may include how code comments should be formatted into HTML.
