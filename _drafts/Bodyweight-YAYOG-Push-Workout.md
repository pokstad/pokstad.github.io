title: Bodyweight YAYOG Push Workout #1
---

My workouts are always evolving. I do three strength training workouts per week: Push/Pull/Legs (it's a little more complex than that, but let's keep it simple until I get to the other workouts).

My current push workout is about 53 minutes:

1. 6-10 minute warm up of skipping rope
1. 2 rounds of supersets (2 times each)
1. 2 rounds of interval sets (2 times each)
1. A ladder of dive bombers
1. Rest
1. Finish the workout with a whole body workout (Burpees no push up)
