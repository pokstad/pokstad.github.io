	<h2>Philosophy</h2>
	<p>My ultimate career goal is to always make my last role obsolete through a combination of engineering and mentoring. I believe that being transparent and sharing knowledge creates the best collaboration environment with my peers. Software engineering is extremely rewarding when you constantly push yourself to conquer problems so that you can focus on the next one. Being a good engineer means that you must always be willing to get out of your comfort zone to learn a new skill or approach a problem differently. Software is enabling the human race to become exponentially efficient in everything that we do and I am excited to be a part of that.</p>
