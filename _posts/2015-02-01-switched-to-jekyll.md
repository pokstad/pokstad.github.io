Due to my hectic schedule with YAYOG, I'm switching to Github/Jekyll hosting for my site. I don't have enough time to actively develop a brand new blogging system AND blog. By using this already stable system, it will give me the freedom to jot down my notes. I'll still pursue a CouchDB blogging system, but for now I won't use it to host until it's stable enough.
