Got those eyes that stare into my soul
Got that smile when I’m giving you my all
You're the brighter side of things
You're the lighter side of life
When all the joy that you bring is why I need you in my life

Can I call you home?
You be mine and I’ll be yours
I just want to let you know
In my mind I’ll call you home

the only thing that I ever knew is that I’ll never know
I’ve had my time in the sun and now I gotta go
your the brighter side of things
your the lighter side of life
when all the joy that you bring is why i need you in my life

can i call you home?
you be mine and i’ll be yours
i just want to liet you know
in my mind i call you home

in my mind
in my mind
in my mind
in my mind

can i call you home?
you be mine and i’ll be yours
i just want to let you know
in my mind i call you home.

can i call you home?
you be mine and i’ll be yours
i just want to let you know
in my mind i call you home.

in my mind i call you home…
