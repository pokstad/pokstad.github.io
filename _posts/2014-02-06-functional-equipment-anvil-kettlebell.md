I purchased a 53 lb (24kg) Anvil kettlebell from functionalequipment.com in Costa Mesa, CA. I really like this kettlebell, and I wish Functional Fitness would keep their inventory stocked so I could buy a another one.

### Pro's
* Wide handle is great for two handed swings and goblet hold exercises.
* Wide flat bottom is great for renegade rows.

### Con's
* Finish wears off a bit too easily (maybe I'm just too rough)
* Vendor does not keep KB's in stock (I WANT ANOTHER 53LB KB!!!)

### Conclusion
Very happy, and I want to buy another!
