## Pros ##
* Syncs to atomic clock in CO.
* Second hand ticks precisely on marks. Same goes for minute and hour hands. (If they ever go off, Tough Mvt is suppose to compensate.)
* Unlike digital displays, this is always easy to read, even in low light and at an angle.
* Perpetual calendar
* 24 hour dial lets you glance at how much time you wasted today.
* Large military/aviator style numbers for easy reading.
* Stopwatch is accurate to 1/100 second
* Has alarm function
* Dial for 2nd time zone also indicates minutes, which is great for timezones with 0.5 offsets.
* Home time zone and away time zone are easily swappable for when traveling between two locations frequently.
* Despite all the extra analog functions, the main dial always displays the time.
* A fresher style when compared to traditional analog chronographs.
* Hard to accidentally press buttons, require a solid push to activate.
* Fairly silent watch, hard to accidentally make sound.
* Very comfortable.

## CONS ##
* Only 24 minute stopwatch
* Stopwatch dial must transition from 2nd time zone to starting position before you can start (this can take several seconds depending on the hands position)
* 1/100 dial is extremely hard to read
* Only one alarm
* No hourly chime
* No countdown timer
* Hour and minute hands are controlled by the same motor, which means they take longer to settle when swapping time zones (but that doesn't happen often)
* Hard to use stopwatch function when the hour and/or minute hand are pointing near 3 o'clock.
* Second hand has no lume (seems ridiculous to me), as well as stopwatch and 24 hour dial.
* Extremely thick (it can get in the way when reaching into pockets)
* Living in Los Angeles area, the watch does not sync every night (more like one out of every 3 or 4 nights, which is okay).
* Bit of a learning curve (but if you're semi competent, then you'll figure it out)
* Alarm is very quiet (don't depend on it to wake you up)

## CONCLUSION ##

I really like this watch and I plan on holding onto it for a long time. In retrospect, I understand the strengths of its successor the GW4000:

* Larger dial for stopwatch functions
* Larger dial diameter makes the watch thinner

And the advantages of the GWA1000:

* Individual motor for both minute and hour hand allows them to be set much faster. Eliminates need for secondary dial for stopwatch functions.

However, I feel the GW3000BB & GW4000 are superior to the GWA1000 in that they always display the current time and have fewer moving parts (electronic crown).
